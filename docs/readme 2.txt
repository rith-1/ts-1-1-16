OVERVIEW
// cipher.txt receives two strings
// each character in the first string represents an actual letter of the alphabet
// each character in the second string represents the corresponding cipher match of the first string’s character
// the program completely deciphers user given ciphered text using the two given strings
// the program indexes the current character of the text to be deciphered and replaces the current character from the cipher character with the actual character in the alphabet

PSEUDOCODE
// print title and global, string variables of string = actual character and string = ciphered character fully
// print starting on the next space in the file
// create a scanner object
// take in user input and check whether user has written a command
// when the proper command is given, use the helper method to convert the user’s next line (text input) into deciphered text
// helper method will be called decipherText
// given string (user input) from cipher method, iterate through each character
// find identical character in string = actual and record index i
// find character at index i in string = cipher
// add the character to a newly created string
// return string

TEST
// tests for load key method
// 1. return unsuccessful (file not found exception) load key method when incorrect argument
// is added (a string that is not a file path)
// 2. return unsuccessful (file not found exception) load key method when incorrect
// argument is added with cipher variable modified

// tests for decipher method
// 1. return successful decipher method when both variables are instantiated
// to equal lengths and the word is correctly deciphered
// 2. return failed (null) decipher method when variables have different lengths
// 3. return failed (null) decipher method when one variable is instantiated to empty string
// 4. return failed (null) decipher method when one variable (cipher) is not instantiated
// 5. return failed (null) decipher method when other variable (actual) is not instantiated

// tests for cipher accessor method
// 1. return cipher when modified
// 2. return default cipher

// tests for actual accessor method
// 1. return actual when modified
// 2. return default actual
