This program is responsible for reading the text file and outputting its text stream.
It has a getter and setter method for variable filepath and a central method called ReadFile.
Readfile takes filepath as an argument and attempts to read the file and output it. This
throws an exception if the file is not found.
String variable file_data is returned

PSUEDOCODE

public String filepath ="sample text"
public string ReadFile(filepath)
    String file_data="sample text"
    try
    while filepath.hasnextline
        file_output=read.filepath
    catch (exception e)
        print("Something went wrong")

    return file_output

Tests
1. Filename Cypher mispelled as cipher-input(cipher.txt)-expected output "File not found exception"
2  filename cypher  with text "abc"-input(cypher.txt)-expected output file_output="abc"
3. no filename entered-input - expected output-thrown exception file not found
